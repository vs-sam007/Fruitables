# Fruitables 🍎🥦

A simple and clean responsive website for a Fruits & Vegetables grocery store / e-commerce store — built with HTML, SCSS/CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔎 About

Fruitables is a front-end project designed to simulate an online grocery store — offering a selection of fruits and vegetables for sale.  
It’s useful as a template for learners or as a pre-built basis for a functional e-commerce site.  

**Tech stack:**  
- HTML (for markup)  
- SCSS / CSS (for styling)  
- JavaScript (for interactive behavior)  

This project can be used to showcase basic web-dev skills (responsive design, layouts, styling, front-end interaction) or can be extended to a full-fledged grocery web app.
